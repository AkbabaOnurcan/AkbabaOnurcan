- 👋 Hello first of all. I hope the person reading my bio is happy. I am Onur , now I will introduce myself with the translation, because my English level is beginner. I'm sorry if I'm wrong. In the last quarter of 2021, I became interested in the software field and started to take training. I am 28 years old. I came across Blockchain and bitcoin in 2016 and started making buy and sell transactions. I took trade training and I saw that Blokchain alone was incomplete. So I thought I should get software training. I am currently taking software training, I joined githup to improve myself more. I want to improve myself on Blockchain - web3 - smart contract and similar issues. But first of all, I have to learn to write code and programming language. Thank you, I wish you a good and happy life :)
- 👀 I am interested in Web development as a first step. Then I will learn many sofwatare language programs.
- 🌱 I am currently training HTML - CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
- 💞️ I would like to join if I can get Starter training in software or if there is a startup team environment. I am very open to information. I'm open to help on this. thanks.
- 📫 You can contact me via akbaba.onurcan@hotmail.com, thank you.
