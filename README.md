- 👋 Hello, I am Onur, now I will introduce myself with the translation, because my English level is beginner. I'm sorry if I'm wrong. In the last quarter of 2021, I became interested in the software field and started to take training. I am 28 years old. I got involved in githup to gain skills and improve skills. Even if I started software at a late age, I believe that I will be very successful. Because I know that really wanting to succeed brings success in every business. thanks.
- 👀 I am interested in Web development as a first step. Then I will learn many sofwatare language programs.
- 🌱 I am currently training HTML - CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
- 💞️ I would like to join if I can get Starter training in software or if there is a startup team environment. I am very open to information. I'm open to help on this. thanks.
- 📫 You can contact me via akbaba.onurcan@hotmail.com, thank you.
